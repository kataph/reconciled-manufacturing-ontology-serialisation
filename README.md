The .clif axioms were parsed with cltools: https://github.com/cmungall/cltools
In particular, a conversion of these axioms in tptp format obtained with this tool is also attached.

The .clif file does not import other .clif files, though some already exists that contain DOLCE primitives (e.g. those in the COLORE repository:  https://github.com/gruninger/colore). This is because such files contain a versione of DOLCE that is not align with most recent work.
